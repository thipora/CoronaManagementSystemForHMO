# Corona Management System for Health Insurance Fund

## Overview
This project implements a management system for handling data related to members, vaccinations, and corona patients for a Health Insurance Fund. It provides functionalities to create and retrieve data regarding corona patients. The system is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB Atlas.

## Project Structure
The project consists of several components:

- **Controllers**: Contains the logic to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Models**: Defines the data schemas using Mongoose for MongoDB.
- **Routes**: Defines the API endpoints and routes for different functionalities.
- **Database Connection**: Manages the connection to MongoDB Atlas.
- **Environment Variables**: Uses dotenv for managing environment variables.
- **Main Server File**: Sets up the Express.js server and listens for incoming requests.

## Installation and Setup
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
npm install
```

## External Dependencies
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Set up a MongoDB Atlas cluster and update the .env file with the appropriate MongoDB Atlas URI, including your username and password.
- **Node.js and npm**: Install Node.js and npm on your system.

## Running the Service
To start the server, run:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will start listening on the specified port (default is 3000). You can access the endpoints defined in the routes to interact with the system.
