Question1: Written in C++

In this exercise, there is a special case for a triangle with a base of 1 and a base of 3. Since for printing a triangle there can be only one line above with asterisks (*) and only one line below with asterisks (*) equal to the width, for a triangle with a base of 1, regardless of the height, the following will be printed:
- x

And for a triangle with a width of 3, for any height (for a height of 2, it is valid from the outset), the following will be printed:
-   x
- x x x
